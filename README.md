# be8 

This is a 8-bit computer emulator based off [Ben Eater's bread board computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM). 

## Building 

```
make
```

This should build without much fuss on any modern linux distro just by typing 'make'. 

## Running 

Normal 
```
./be8 [path to program]
```
Debug 
```
./be8 -d [path to program]
```

Included are two programs. Both programs were feathred in Ben Eater's videos.

- programs/fib.8 - Displayes the fibonacci sequence as seen in Ben's "[Programming Fibonacci on a breadboard computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a73ZXDJtU48)"
